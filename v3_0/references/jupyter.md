## Using Thonny

The following instructions will help you install Jupyter Notebooks from within
Thonny.

  1. Open Thonny
  2. In the top menu bar, click "Tools" and then "Manage Packages"
  3. In the window that appears, type "jupyter" into the search bar and click "Find packages from Pypi".
  4. In the bottom left, click the "Install" button
  5. The installation should proceed, but may take several minutes.
  6. Once complete, close the "Manage Packages" window
  7. In the console at the bottom, type the following:

```python

!jupyter notebook
```

After a short delay, the Jupyter Notebook environment should open in your
browser.

## Using Anaconda

If you are unable to get Jupyter working from within Thonny, then you can
follow these instructions from the Jupyter website:

First, download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads). We recommend
downloading Anacondaâ€™s latest Python 3 version.

Second, install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the
instructions on the download page.

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the notebook, run
the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

```html

jupyter notebook

```

See [Running the
Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running) for
more details.

## In-Browser Versions

If you cannot get Jupyter installed using either of these methods, you should
rely on one of the publicly hosted versions of Jupyter Notebook. Note that you
may not have access to all regular features of Jupyter Notebooks, and that the
interface may be different. This approach is discouraged and instructional
staff may not be able to help you as much.
