title: String Operations
video: IQKYJ4weBfM
introduction: This class gives a more formal introduction to Strings. Although we covered Strings briefly back when we learned about types, now we're studying them in more depth.
summary: You should now feel comfortable with representing a string in your computer, and then manipulating them.
objectives:
    - Define the concept of a string
    - Create a string literal
    - Create a triple-quoted string
    - Incorporate escape characters into a string
activities:
    - "Lesson: Strings"
    - "Quiz: Strings"
    - "Programming: Strings"
inclass:
    - Present the idea of Strings as a sequence of characters.
    - Give a demo of using strings in BlockPy, highlighting how the string block can take many different values. Show off assigning the string value to a variable, and using the variable and value to print. Also show off how the input() function returns a string.
misconceptions:
    - Students often think that strings with numbers are actually integers.
    - Students sometimes confuse variables and strings.
